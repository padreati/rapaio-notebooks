    "The purpose of the competition is to predict which passengers have survived or not. The available data has two parts. The first part consists in a data set which contains what happened with some passengers and some related information like sex, cabin, age, class, etc. This data set contains information regarding their survival. The purpose why this data set contains survival data is because it will be used to train a model which learns how to decide if a passenger survives or not. This is the `train.csv`. The other file is a data set which contains data about another set of passenger, this time without knowing if they survived or not. They contain, however an identification number. This data set is `test.csv` and this is used to make predictions. Those predictions should be similar with the provided `gendermodel.csv`.\n",

At any moment one can build a kernel for nominal features. But the implemented ones allows only numeric non missing values and is much simpler to shape our data into this format.\n",

The data set inside the filter is filtered to contain only instances with non-missing target values.\n",

The name of this filter is `FOneHotEncoding`. What it does is to create a number of numeric feature for level of the nominal variable. Than the values on these numeric variables receives the value of the indicator function. We have $1$ if the level equals the numeric variable's name, $0$ otherwise.\n",

    "After we have numerical variables, is better to make all the variables to be in the same range. This is not a requirement for SMVs in general. The meaning is to give same weight to all the involved variables. As a side effect it makes the algorithm to run faster. This is due to the fact that the convex optimization problem has smaller chances to have a close-to-flat big surfaces.\n",

    "The results are not promising. This is better than random but it is not enough for our purpose. There are some explanations for this result. First one could be that if the space would be linear, than the original feature space would be the same as transformed. This means that a classifierModel as random forest would work well if the linear svm would have worked. This might not be true in general, but in this case it looks like a good explanation. We need to be more flexible.\n",

    "To increase the flexibility of the model and to allow features to interact with one another we change the degree of the polynomial kernel. This time we will use `degree=3`. Also, we use $$C=0.0001$$ to allow for some errors. This parameter is the factor of the slack regularization constraints of the SVM optimization problem. The bigger the value the more is the penalty for wrong decisions. If the space would be linear separable than one can theoretically set this value as high as possible. But we know it is not. Also we know that we have plenty of irreducible error. As a consequence, it looks like we should decrease the value of this parameter.\n",

The difference which sometimes is important is that it is a distribution with tails fatter than Gaussian distribution. This produces an effect of long distance influence.

    "Using random forests or SVMs did not provided us with a result over $$0.8$$. We have two very different types of models which performed well. For the sole purpose of prediction we use a nice ensemble technique which often provides good prediction performance gain. This technique is called stacking.\n",

But often times a proper interpretation is really hard to find. Each interpretation of the solution can have good points and weak points. The idea is to blend those interpretations into a single one in a way that we try somehow to keep what is string from each individual classifierModel.\n",
